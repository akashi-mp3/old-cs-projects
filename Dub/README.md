## Project Description:
Dub Dates is an innovative dating site. Users will be allowed to make a profile and take a survey to determine their interests and preferences. Users are then given a list of other users who fulfill the userâ€™s preferences. A user is then given the option to message and individual. Moreover, our project will provide users with a list of events and places near both users such that a user is able to invite another user to an event on a specific time and date.
